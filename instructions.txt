
// Setting up the data files

The "data" folder has all of the source data for the script, all files are in .csv format

dfc_ranks.csv -> the data for the summary page with all hospitals
dfc_stats -> the summary stats for each hospital
ethnicity.csv -> the ethnicity data
gender.csv -> the gender data

In order for the script to run, the data files need to be in the exact same format as the templates. There is a folder called "template" which has the correct format for each file. Use these template files for reference, but save all data files under the "data" folder.

The numbers must be in decimal format, not percent. Example: .86 instead of 86%

The headers have to stay the same. Example: in ethnicity.csv, "Hospital_ID" must be the header for that column, or else the script won't work.




// R Installation and How to Run the Script

download R 3.2.5
	https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/

file -> change dir
	select "srip" folder directory

install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies=TRUE)
	if it asks you to use a personal library, hit "yes"
	select a mirror from the list (pick one in the USA)

install.packages("reshape2", dependencies=TRUE)

to run the program, type: source("run.r")
	you must be in the root directory of the project in order for it to work

the program might be unresponsive while it generates the reports

the output reports will be in the "reports" folder
